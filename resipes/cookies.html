    <h3 class="text">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="small2">
      <li>120g Butter</li>
      <li>75g light brown sugar</li>
      <li>75g golden caster sugar</li>
      <li>1 medium egg</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>180g plain flour</li>
      <li>0.5 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
      <li>150g dark chocolate</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="small2">
      <li>
        Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with
        parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cream the butter and sugars together until very light and fluffy, then
        beat in the egg and vanilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once combined, stir in the flour, bicarb, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough space
        between each to allow for spreading.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at the edges but still soft in the
        middle – they will harden a little as they cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm, or transfer
        to a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep for three days in an
        airtight container.
      </li>
