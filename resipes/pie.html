    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      TMaster the chocolate cake with an airy, light sponge and rich buttercream
      filling. It's simple enough for an afternoon tea but special enough for a
      party too.
    </p>

      <li>200g unsalted butter</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>200 self-raising flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>2 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
      <li>0.5 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
      <h6>For the burretcream</h6>
      <li>100g milk chocolate</li>
      <li>200g icing sugar</li>
      <li>5 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Butter the base and sides of two 20cm
        round sandwich tins and line the bases with baking parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, beat together 200g golden caster sugar, 200g softened
        unsalted butter, 4 large eggs, 200g self-raising flour, 2 tbsp cocoa
        powder, 1 tsp baking powder, ½ tsp vanilla extract, 2 tbsp milk and a
        pinch of salt until pale.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the mixture between the prepared tins. Bake for 20 mins or until
        a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to
        cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the buttercream, put 100g chopped milk chocolate in a heatproof bowl
        and melt in the microwave, stirring every 30 secs. Leave the melted
        chocolate to cool for 5 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mash 200g softened butter and 400g icing sugar together with a fork,
        then switch to a wooden spoon or electric beaters, if you have them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift in 5 tbsp cocoa powder with a pinch of salt and pour in the melted
        chocolate and 2 tbsp milk. Mix again until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a cake stand or large plate, sandwich the cakes together with half of
        the buttercream, then spread the rest on top. Decorate with chocolate
        shards, if you like.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make chocolate shards: melt 50g dark chocolate and pour it onto a
        tray lined with baking parchment or foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now melt 25g milk chocolate and 25g white chocolate and drizzle them
        over the dark chocolate before it sets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shake the tray gently to level the mixture then leave to set somewhere
        cool. Chop into shards.
      </li>
    </ol>
